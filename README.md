# UAV Strategic Deconfliction System

This project is a drone airspace safety checker designed for FlytBase's Robotics Engineer Technical Assessment. It simulates multiple drones operating in shared airspace and determines whether a new drone mission is safe to execute ‚Äî checking for spatial and temporal conflicts with other drones.

## üöÄ Features

- Supports 3D space + time (4D) mission conflict detection
- Interpolates drone paths to check continuous movement, not just waypoints
- Identifies spatial conflicts (within minimum distance)
- Detects temporal overlaps using timestamps
- Visualizes drone trajectories and conflicts
- Scalable and modular architecture

## üìÅ Project Structure


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open `main.py`
2. Set a primary drone mission
3. Choose a test case (conflict / no conflict)
4. Run the script to:
   - Check for conflicts
   - Print results
   - Show a plot (optional)

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `matplotlib`, `numpy`

Install using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ‚úçÔ∏è Design Decisions

My goal was to create a modular, simulation-based safety system that evaluates whether drone missions are safe to run in busy airspace. I structured the project with a clean separation:
- `main.py` handles I/O and test case control
- `deconfliction_system.py` holds the core logic
- `visualization.py` helps to explain and debug
- `test_cases.py` helps verify against known conflict scenarios

I chose Python for flexibility and readability, and used `matplotlib` for rapid 2D/3D plotting.

## üß† Conflict Detection Logic

Instead of comparing waypoints directly, I used **interpolation** to simulate the drone's motion between points. Each trajectory is processed into many `(x, y, z, t)` samples.

Then, for each moment in time, I compare the **Euclidean distance** between drones:
- In 3D space
- At the same or close timestamps (¬±1 second)

If the distance drops below a threshold (2 meters), a conflict is logged.

## ü§ñ How AI Helped

I used Replit AI and ChatGPT during the project to:
- Refactor logic and improve modularity
- Quickly build the interpolation algorithm
- Debug corner cases and incorrect results
- Generate base templates for README and reflection

AI accelerated development but I always reviewed the code line-by-line to ensure it met the specific requirements and handled edge cases like altitude-only overlaps.

## üåç Scaling to 10,000+ Drones

To scale this system:
- Replace nested loops with **spatial indexing** (like R-Trees or KD-Trees)
- Use **distributed computing** (Ray, Dask) to parallelize conflict checks
- Stream real-time data using Kafka or MQTT
- Use **zone-based caching** to ignore far-away drones
- Store missions in a spatial database (PostGIS or MongoDB with GeoJSON)

With these changes, the system could realistically manage tens of thousands of drones in real-time airspace.
